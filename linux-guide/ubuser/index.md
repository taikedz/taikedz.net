Guides

* Searching for stuff rather than clicking around
	* Example - customizing the desktop and keyboard
* Using AlternativeTo.net
* adding software - synaptic, command line (provide links to paf ?)
	* example: installing alternative web browser, flash, and an up to date LibreOffice from PPA
* Partitioning USB drives for use anywhere (re-writing them as FAT32) with GParted
* Automatic backups configuration
* Creating a backup bootable USB/DVD
	* Ubuntu MATE live USB - lighter than the rest?

This SHOULD cover basic bases.
