Intention for the table of contents

mdpublish should pre-process files to look for TOC entries

The entry is a path to the .md file - it allows the .md file to be located, but to add the link as .html

The TOC string is removed

If the MD file is not found, no link is created around the line

If the MD file is found, we CD to that directory and run mdpublish on it ; and then add a link to the original line

mdpublish should seek to NOT publish to the current working directory, instead it should publish to one set in preferences file

mdpublish should be able to keep track of paths, forbid ".." paths, and re-create the directory structure in the target directory

mdpreview should write the written list to stdout
