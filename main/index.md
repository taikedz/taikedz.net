# TaiKedz.net


Welcome to Taikedz.net.

Ther is not much here at the moment. It's still being built. At some point I'll host the code behind the templates, and the tools used to build it. Deliberately, I am trying to keep it as simple as possible. It's not Web 1.0, nor Web 2.0 ; but more a Web 1.7.3 pre-alpha rc1 ...

Topics I intend to explore include

* Linux - system administration for DevOps and such on Ubuntu mainly... and some CentOS
* Minetest - a great open source game, a competitor to MineCraft. And no MineCraft was not the first - it was copying Infiniminer ;-)
* Bash Programming - because I'm a programmatical masochist.
