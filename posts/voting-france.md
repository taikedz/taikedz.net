.. description: Some songs I remember that are very à propos today
.. type: text
-->

This post is mostly musings on some old songs, about political apathy and the desire to care, "*if-only*". I was intending on making more of an analysis and commentary, but after translating both and reflecting, I'm a little at a loss as to what I am thinking or understanding from anything today. So I'm just going to throw them out there, and write something else another time, maybe for the second round, and the UK General Election.

<hr />

Just remembered a couple of songs when thinking about the French elections happening today, Sunday 2017 April 23rd.

Up here in Scotland I'm used to the sweet and longing songs for Caledinia and the Celtic Isles, there's most defenitely a tradition of that in Scotland and Irelan. But in France, I had forgotten how modern songs, at least that which aired when I gre up there, had always been so dejected and disgusted with the country that was still home.

Below are trnaslations of two of them (both from pre-2000), with a couple of notes. The first speaks mostly I feel of political dejection, mostly composed of short, bitter interjections; the second more of the cultural apathy ingrained in the French youths, since they feel their voice is insignificant, and the only way to cope is to accept everything, and use partying as a way to numbe the pain.

Neither are joyful, and neither give hope for the future. Given the political tension today across Europe as a whole, I feel this has come back to resonate with me once more.

And yet, the only way forward would be to hope, even against all odds - it's the only thing we can do, whatever our political opinions or leanings are.

### Un jour en France

by Noir Désir

[![Un jour en France](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JuB-YSltTgU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuB-YSltTgU "Un jour en France")

	At the bistrot as usual
	they're talking big and bold
	At the bar the rotten dudes, and the corrupt ones too
	Ravenous white teeth
	But at the first opportunity
	Each becomes a thief
	Of the cash fayre that's going down here
	Come on, dance with Johnny (1)

	Remembering France
	Having some recollections
	Of order, games and the essence
	Of better days
	Paul and Mickey were there (2)
	We could talk it through
	But it was Mickey who won
	Oky, let's not mention it ever again

	Another day in France
	Praying for fascinating
	15% tune-in ratings
	Charlie, stand up for me!! (3)
	We've got not choice, heads or tails
	And today, I swear nothing's up
	Always a little bit more
	[National Front], a suffering
	Ain't it good to be in France
	It's time to convert the cash
	We should be re-printing the dream of equality
	And we should never remove that of fraternity
	And still remains an ellipsis (4)
	
Translation notes:

This song is a bit of a lyrical mess, probably owing to the lyrics being more bitter interjectios than a full expression of disgust, full of cultural references of the time - notably, the French National Front party is still there, as symbol of political nastiness that nonetheless has more attention than centrists and leftists are comfortable with.

* (1) I think this is a reference to Johnny Halliday, a successful French musician who made his name by using American 50's style rock-n-roll with a uniquely French makeover, probably in reference to American influences, but also to some degree a form of escapism (American culture, whilst willingly adopted on many fronts, has never been truly beloved in France, at least, not whilst I was growing up there, roundsabout when this song came out).
* (2) Again, I suspect there's some cultural reference to what American culture is doing to French culture, and that French culture, on the whole, is losing its identity in the face of cultural imports
* (3) Not sure if this is a reference to Charlie Hebdo, as a grotesque remedy to inane poitical news casting?
* (4) In the original text, the word is *pointillés*, which could mean the three dots of an ellipsis, or a dotted line - a reference perhaps to contracts, right after references to moral values printed on bank notes

### Jeune et con

by Damien Saez

[![Jeune et con](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4gYW6lK50gI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gYW6lK50gI "Jeune et con")

	Another day breaks on planet France (sic)
	And I wake slowly from my dreams, to enter the dance
	As usual it's 8 in the evening, I've slept all through the day
	I went to be too late again, I've made myself deaf

	Another evening in which youth France (sic)
	Is going to have fun again, since nothing here makes sense
	So we're going to go dance, and pretend we're happy
	And listlessly go to bed, and tomorrow nothing will be any better

	Since we're young and stupid
	Since they're old and crazy
	Since men die under bridges
	But this world won't give a damn
	Since we're just pawns
	Fine with just kneeling
	Since I know one day we too will gain from going crazy

	Another day breaks on planet France
	But I've long since lost my dreams, I know too well this dance
	As usual it's 8 in the evening, I slept all through the day
	But I know we're a few billion looking for love

	Another evening in which youth France
	Is going to have fun again in this state of emergency
	So we're going to go dance, and pretend we exist
	Who knows, if we close our eyes, we'll live to be old

	Since we're young and stupid
	Since they're old and crazy
	Since men die under bridges
	But this world won't give a damn
	Since we're just pawns
	Fine with just knkeeling
	Since I know that one day we'll love
	Like crazy

	Another day breaks on planet France
	And I've long since lost my dreams, I know too well this dance

	Another day breaks on planet France
	But I've long since lost my dreams, I know too well this dance
	As usual it's 8 in the evening, I slept all through the day
	But I know we're a few billion looking for love

Translation notes:

This song is a bit more straightforward, describing the despondency of youth of the day towards the state of the country (*state of emergency* deliberately used in the original text). The older generation sees the younger one as stupid and lazy, the young see the older generation as crazy and out of touch, and the result is complete despondency of the youth. It doesn't matter what youths do, their voice won't carry, they *pretend to exist*, even marches and demonstrations are just big parties at this point, nobody truly believes anybody is listening.

There's a sliver of positivity in stating that we're nonetheless *a few billion looking for love*, and I'm pretty sure that by this it means mutual acceptance at a personal level, and peace at a more global, political level, where young and old finally sit down and listen to eachother.

But since we're young and stupid, and they're old and crazy, that doesn't look like it's going to happen, and even today we see that pattern of talk, with over in Britain Brexits being "blamed" on the conservative oldies by the liberal youth. It's a divide that will probably play out in France.... again.
