Having grown up and been educated in Sèvres, France, I have been living in Scotland for the better part of 14 years (and counting), now in Edinburgh.

Most of my hobbies revolve around coding - be it automation scripts for Linux for server and desktop, deployment and maintenance of Minetest game servers, or writing Lua code for [Minetest](https://minetest.net) mods or trying to start making games in [LőVE](https://love2d.org/).

Active in the Edinburgh Linux User Group and at TechMeetup, when I'm not doing computer-geeky stuff, I can generally be found at Captain's Bar enjoying some good old Irish/Scottish traditional fol music (and perhaps playing a bit too if I can pluck up the courage).
